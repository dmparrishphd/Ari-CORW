Panel Input
===========

Panel input consists of _scanning_ and _queueing_.
We call these two together a _query_.

During panel input, you enter a line of text.

Provided that the line is not too long and contains only
characters among the [_basic-characters_](./character-sets.md), the words found
therein are placed in a queue.

In the context of panel input, a word is a contiguous sequence
of [_basic-graph_](./character-sets.md) characters.
