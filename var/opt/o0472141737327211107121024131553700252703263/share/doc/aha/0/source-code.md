Source Code
===========

Each source code file is short.
Lines are almost always fewer than 80 characters.
`INT_MAX` lines in one source file is _way_ too many!

Received wisdom seems to be that code indenting should be used primarily to indicate levels of nesting.
However, if code is short, we do not need this crutch.
This means that we can use indentation to indicate someting else.
We have discovered a new tool.
